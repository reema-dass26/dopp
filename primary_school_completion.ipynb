    "# Exploring the state of global primary education\n",
    "\n",
    "*Reema George Dass 12144026, Simon Glatzer 12019265, Harald Hubinger 09426524, Valentin Schweitzer 51829840*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to provide an insight into the current state of global primary education by looking specifically at the primary school completion rate. In this case \"current\" means the last full year unaffected by the CoViD-19 pandemic (i.e. 2019), because taking into account the implications of the disruptions caused by it would go beyond the scope of this project and data availability drastically decreases from 2020 onwards. In the course of this analysis we will attempt to answer the following four questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question 1** In all countries across the world, how many children finish primary school in 2019?\n",
    "- **Question 2** How is the result from question 1 affected by the income of the countries?\n",
    "- **Question 3** Is it possible to identify objectively reasons for children not finishing school. What factors influencing the completion rate can be identified?\n",
    "- **Question 4** How well can predictions be made for the figures 5 and 10 years in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data sources\n",
    "#### Primary school completion rates.\n",
    "The data we are working on is mainly taken from the World Bank databank, which compiles data accumulated by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS). However, additional sources had to be consulted in order to fill in missing values. These are data on primary education from the education ministry of the People's Republic of China, numbers from Statista on Nigeria, from MICS (Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, a UNICEF programme) on Vietnam, from MICS-EAGLE (MICS specifically aimed at education) on Bangladesh, from UNICEF on Myanmar and from Kenya's ministry of education.  We tried to stick as closely as possible to data from official international institutions like the World Bank or UNESCO, because these are usually more transparent than specific governments, who might have an agenda behind their published data, which is not to say the data from such organisations can be expected to be 100% correct or unbiased. This is because the international organisations often also have to draw their information from governmental data, and we can think about different motivations of countries reporting data biased in one or the other direction. There could be incentives to report better than actural rates in order to polish a country's reputation. On the other hand reporting lower rates could be driven by availability of development funds. Further investigations into this would however go beyond the scope of this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary dataset treats \"completion\" as enrollment in the last grade of primary education. This, as stated in the original definition, does not consider students dropping out in the last grade. The rate of completion is calculated by dividing the number of enrollments by the number of people at the foreseen age of enrollment for the last grade. This sometimes results in values above 100%, which is caused by older or younger students finishing primary school For more information on this definition, consult the UNESCO Institute of Statistics website: http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Other countries may define completion rate differently in their official reports. Examples include:\n",
    "* Graduation of last grade as a condition for \"completion\" (MICS, MICS-EAGLE, China, Kenya).\n",
    "* Division by first-year enrollments as opposed to eligible population (China, Kenya).\n",
    "* Percentage of children above a certain age who graduated from the last grade (MICS, MICS-EAGLE).\n",
    "* A different definition of \"primary school\", i.e. possible incompatibilities to ISCED-1 (https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Classification_of_Education) Difficult to determine).\n",
    "\n",
    "More detailed documentation on the compilation of the data is under `./datasets/combined_sources.md` and `./datasets/README.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### World population data\n",
    "We used historic to present world population data from the World Bank available under https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL as https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?downloadformat=csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Human Development Index data\n",
    "We extensively used data from the United Nations Development Human Development Reports (https://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2021-22_HDR/HDR21-22_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv) which was used there to compute the Human Development Index. This dataset, besides the HDI also contains all the variables contributing to the HDI as documented in https://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2021-22_HDR/HDR21-22_Composite_indices_metadata.xlsx. The individual variables are documented under question 2 and 3 and as documented in question 3 we did not use the HDI directly but only its input variables as we would otherwise have counfounded the analysis for two of our main questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially this data also contains the GNI per capita on purchasing power parity for 2017 back to 1990. For financial data we  also investigated the GNIPC data from World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS), but chose the HDI data in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rurality data\n",
    "We used percentages of rural population per country from World Bank Data available under https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS as https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SP.RUR.TOTL.ZS?downloadformat=csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Child labour data\n",
    "Child labour data has been taken from UNICEF available under https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/child-labour/ as  https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/XLS_Child-labour-database_May-2022.xlsx. This data is only available for a small set of countries, as child labour mainly plays a role for the very poor countries. UNICEF provides further information on methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data quality and preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall data quality\n",
    "Parts of this have already been treated under data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the school completion rates it can be said that data quality is different for different countries. We found fluctuations for example in the school completion rates of China which have to be attributed to the quality or methodology of measurement there. Nevertheless it's not really feasible to find good basis to decide if values should be excluded from the analysis. Under question 1 we also mention completion rates above 100% (especially in some small countries) for which explanations could be found. To further investigate their plausibility would also exceed what could be done for this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "HDI, rurality and child labour data looked good overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data cleaning\n",
    "The collected data sets for school completion rates were manually cleaned by removing elements unnecessary for the analysis and correcting formatting errors in the files. Afterwards, the data sets were partially merged to create a more centralised data structure and make them easier to access. Most of the data was already in an easily accessible form as it was taken for example from the World Bank databank, which provides the information in an easy-to-use way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing values\n",
    "Many countries do **not regularly** report their primary education stats and some of them **don't report at all**. In the first case, the missing data was obtained by linear interpolation where we had data before and after 2019 and if only older data was available we used constant extrapolation (i.e. the value for the closest year). We considered this an adequate imputation strategy at first hand, but also try to model these values in question 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second case, we used the aforementioned additional data sets obtained from a variety of sources which might come at the price of reduced direct comparability. Also, these values we model for question 4 to see the differences between the regression and the data from different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "More on missing values can be found in the sections where it is relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outliers\n",
    "Besides the aforementionned considerations on the \"bumpyness\" of some time series and the questionable \"overachievers\" we could not determine data from nuisance processes - also under the assumption that we're not able to put more scrutiny into the redaction of this data than UN / World Bank statistics which we consider very reliable data sources - and therefore did not exclude any outlying data.

    "\n",
    "The plots show us that at a GNI per capita of slightly above USD $10\\,000$ countries seem to reach the ability to cater for a more or less saturated degree of primary school completion. Beyond that threshold we can still see some  decrease in variability. Below this number variability seems higher and extreme poverty seems to be a clear hindrance for achievement. The level actually reached most probably also depend on other factors such as good governance or political priorities. We will go into further investiagions in question $3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's of course a good basis for the assumption that the observed trend is not only a correlation in the data but is also based on causality as education costs a tremendous amount of money, it needs infrastructure and last but not least also cooperation from the families of the children, since under conditions of extreme poverty children are often engaged in child labour, either employed or in subsistence economy."

    "\n",
    "After analysing all the relevant influencing factors, we can now try to identify reasons for children not finishing primary school.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first major factor we looked at was the life expectancy, which as an indicator hints to a healthy population supported by a strong health care system. From this one might gather that a healthy body of students is more likely to graduate than one affected by illnesses, which does seem to make sense, since being ill can negatively affect one's cognitive capabilites apart from the fact that an illness might even force children to stay home and not attend school.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two other major points are the mean and expected years of schooling which in this case might stand to represent the development of the educational system in a country, a longer time in school meaning a more developed system with an increased focus on secondary and tertiary education. That focus might reduce the importance of a primary education alone, while strengthening it as the prerequisite for pursuing a higher education and as such becoming even more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furhtermore, child labour was also identified as a factor affecting the graduation rate. This does also seem natural, since a child who has to participate in sustaining its family at an early age might not have the time to pursue an education.\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, the inequality in a society was also identified as a reason for children not graduating from primary school. This includes both general inequality in society, meaning the individual's access to health care, wealth and education, regardless of their respective quality, and gender inequality, this being the difference between the genders male and female. This does seem to make sense, as a more unequal distribution of resources in a society allows fewer people the freedom to pursue an education, not plagued by any of the other factors mentioned before.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not really possible to \"objectively\" identify reasons for children not finishing primary school since this rate is influenced by so many vastly different factors, we can only establish hypotheses on what might alter the state of primary completion rate in a country."

    "From the other questions we looked at in our analysis we see, that there's a strong dependence of educational achievement and other especially economy and development related variables. These variables are themselves very hard to predict for which reason for example forecasts of economic growth are usually only done for comparably short periods of time, e.g. for governmental budget planning. Disruptive events like the COVID-19 pandemic (which is not depicted in our data) also make clear how quickly even relatively short time forecasts can become obsolete and global trends can be interrupted. To this end it's very instructive to have a short glimpse at https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI and look at the turn from 2019 to 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that this strong correlation with external factors also doesn't allow for useful time series modeling which would allow to predict the completion rates based on their inner dynamics (as we could probably do for monthly rainfall). So any attempt to build a model for primary school completion into the longer future would more or less build on sandy ground.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "Accurate primary school completion rates are quite difficult to adequately determine. For some countries hardly any data can be found. We investigated a pluritude of datasets which differed in applied methodology for their respective generation. Data collection constituted a tremendous amount of the total effort for this project. The main challenge in the work was to keep track of the variety of data used and to use it in a sensible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found many influential factors for the school completion rates and investigated only the most promising among them. Remarkably, there is a pattern in all the dependencies, from which one could hypothesize, that at some level of development of a country a saturated level for the primary school completion can be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "We juxtaposed worldwide achieved completion rates found by using our main data set and linear interpolation / constant extapolation / auxiliary datasets with values we could find by using a regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression model fitted quite well on the test data and seems to be useful to estimate completion rates for countries which don't report (regularly). Nevertheless, we do not consider such a model useful to predict future values, as a main part of its explanatory variables would have to be forecast themselves. Further to this the random forest regression model we used is not easily to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found a significant difference between these two values which might be due to the fact that constant extrapolation does not actually account for global development. The temporal scope here ends in 2019, it would however be interesting to use the model to calculate current values and compare them to reported ones since the constant uprise in global development as can be seen in the overall development of the HDI changed to a slight decline in 2020 with the COVID pandemic."
