# DOPP26
- **The main notebook to be run is `./primary_school_completion.ipynb`.**
- It runs some small notebooks in `./src/` which prepare data.
- All datasets which were downloaded or produced can be found in `./datasets/`, also documentation for the datasets is there.
- `./target` contains .pickle-Files which are generated by the auxiliary notebooks and collected by the main notebook.
- `src_unused/` and `datasets_unused` just contain intermediate results or data which was of interest, but not used. These can be ignored.
